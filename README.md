# Detroit-blight-data-science-project
An analysis of possible predictors for blight events in Detroit using machine learning techniques.
Some of the source data has been uploaded to this repository, but a couple of files are too large (detroit-blight-violations.csv and detroit-crime.csv); they can be downloaded from http://data.detroitmi.gov
